# Prediciting-Fines-Using-Gradient-Boosted-Decision-Trees
Predicted whether blight tickets would go unpaid using blight ticket data from the city of Detroit.
After trying out Logistic Regressors, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, I decided to use Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees.
Tuned the parameters to achieve a final AUC score of 0.776207237804 on the test data.  
Done as part of the Coursera course: "Applied Machine Learning in Python".
